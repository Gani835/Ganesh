Procedural oriented programming Language (P.O.P):-

* Procedural oriented programming language is used for designing medium-sized programs
* It is derived from structural programming and based on calling procedures.
* Procedural programming follows a top-down approach during the designing of a program. 
* In this a large program divided into smaller parts are called as "functions".
* As compared to object-oriented programming, procedural programming is "less secure". 
* Procedural programming does not have the concept of inheritance.
* There is no code reusability present in procedural programming
* It offers code reusability by using the feature of inheritance.
* The major disadvantage includes "lack of code reusability".
* Examples of Procedural programming include C, Fortran, Pascal, and VB,etc.	












Object oriented programming Language (OOPS):-

* Object orientd programming language is used for designing large and complex programs. 
* Object oriented programming follows a bottom-up approach during the designing of a program.
* In OOP, a program is divided into small parts that are referred to as "objects".
* Data hiding is possible in object-oriented programming due to abstraction. So, it is more secure than procedural programming.
* There is a feature of inheritance in object-oriented programming.
* It offers code reusability by using the feature of inheritance.
* It gives importance to data over function.
* The examples of object-oriented programming are -
  .NET, C#, Python, Java, VB.NET, and C++,PHP,Scala,etc.



Object-oriented programming is based on mainly four basic concepts.

1.Abstarction:- Abstraction in Python is the process of hiding the real implementation of an application from the user and emphasizing only on usage of it

* It makes the complex logic hide behind and makes the system easy to use for a user.
* It allows the particular code to be efficiently reused while avoiding complexity.
* It ensures the security of the system.

2. Encapsulation:-
